# CatanGNN-AI
Catan Development + AI (Deep Learning Project).
Now:
In this moment I'm implementing a version of this in which I will apply more suitable Reinforcement Learning techniques by my self. Giacomo Ettore Rocco
Before:
This project started as a simple project to test a supervised learning approach (which is really wrong in this case, and didn't work properly) on a stoacastic game called Settlers Of Catan. 
This first simple approch was made with the collaboration of Alessandro Nuzzi and Riccardo Zulla.
