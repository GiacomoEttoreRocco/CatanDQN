# CatanGNN-AI
Catan Development + AI (Deep Learning Project).
This project was a simple project to test a supervised learning approach (which is really wrong in this case, and didn't work properly) on a stoacastic game called Settlers Of Catan. 
In a future moment I will implement a version of this in which I will apply more suitable Reinforcement Learning techniques.
This program is made with the collaboration of Alessandro Nuzzi and Riccardo Zulla.
